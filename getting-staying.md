## Transport

### Train

There is an Amtrack station in Waterbury (WAB). The train station is
about a 40 minute drive from Fielder Farm.  If you are coming in by
train, please let us know in your RSVP and we will arrange a carpool /
pickup.

If you are flying, we recommend the Burlington (BTV) airport. The
airport is about a 40 minute drive from Fielder Farm.

### Automobile

If you plan to have a car while you're in town, and you would be
willing to help carpool other guests, please let us know!

## Lodging
### Airbnb/VRBO
We recommend staying in an AirBnb or VRBO in the area—they are very cute and tend to be less expensive than hotel rooms.
