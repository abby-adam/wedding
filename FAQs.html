<h2 id="what-should-i-wear">What should I wear?</h2>
<p>Essentially, whatever you want! A couple of things to help guide your
choices: - The ceremony and reception will both take place outdoors on
grass, so we recommend comfortable shoes that won’t sink into the earth.
- The bride and groom are going for “cookout,” “earthy,”
“farm-in-Vermont” vibes.</p>
<h2 id="is-everything-happening-outdoors">Is everything happening
outdoors?</h2>
<p>The groom is a weather person and has promised a dry, mild day. That
being said, if his connections don’t pull through, it might get hot and
it might rain. We will have a tent on site for sun and rain
protection.</p>
<h2 id="should-i-bring-my-children">Should I bring my children?</h2>
<p>To give all of our guests the opportunity to celebrate without having
to worry about little eyes and ears, we respectfully request no children
under the age of 14.</p>
<h2 id="is-it-possible-to-carpool">Is it possible to carpool?</h2>
<p>Hopefully! Here is a <a
href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Qvn_pJGZvPouaGWd94zjVVn4xYP2gvFk_jXsylHV-b0/edit?usp=sharing">spreadsheet</a>
where people can post if they are looking for rides, or if they have a
car with extra seats available (if you are not comfortable editing the
spreadsheet directly, just reach out to us). We anticipate that people
will be driving (and looking for rides) between New York and northern
Vermont, and also locally between Burlington and Fielder Farm on
Saturday.</p>

looking at the pictures on this page—is the wedding buffalo themed?</h2>
<p>No.</p>
