<p>Essentially, whatever you want! A couple of things to help guide your choices: - The ceremony and reception will both take place outdoors on grass, so we recommend comfortable shoes that won’t sink into the earth. - The bride and groom are going for “cookout,” “earthy,” “farm-in-Vermont” vibes.</p>

<p>The groom is a weather person and has promised a dry, mild day. That being said, if his connections don’t pull through, it might get hot and it might rain. We will have a tent on site for sun and rain protection.</p>
<h2 id="should-i-bring-my-children">Should I Bring My Children?</h2>
<p>To give all of our guests the opportunity to celebrate without having to worry about little eyes and ears, we respectfully request no children under the age of 14.</p>
