# Wedding Gifts
![Ping pong in the Park](ping-pong.jpg "Abby crushing Adam.")
----------------------------------

## The bride and groom live in an apartment that is approximately the size of the ping pong table in the photo above. Please do not give them any objects, it will really stress them out. If you would like to do something to celebrate the wedding, please consider one of the following options:

### Send Us a Recipe
Abby and Adam love cooking together. If you have a recipe that is meaningful to you, we would be honored if you [shared it with us here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSflDsgaINNFb1mQ5RrbVeKXHBI4n04-NO79r2ZZ8d_cg_YUjQ/viewform?usp=sf_link). (We promise not to peak until after the wedding).
